# Requirements

This section defines all the parts of the `level Generator`, their limitations and how they communicate with each other.

They are split in two sections:

- [Definitions](#definitions)
- [Generation Order](#generation-order)

## Definitions

In order to understand how the `Level Generator` works, one must first understand all the parts that the `Generator` must manage.

All the necessary definitions are laid out in [their dedicated section](definitions/README.md).

## Generation Order

Once the definitions are understood, the `Level Generator` can [execute the proper steps](generation/README.md).

Each step has its own set of characteristics which must be followed in order to achieve optimal results.
