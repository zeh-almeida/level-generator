# NPC Placement

NPCs must be placed on a stable tile but their orientation depends on their definition. This means NPCs can be placed on the ceiling for example, if their definition and their anchor point allows.

NPCs do not respect the final number of objects in the room because it is used as a generation guide, not a generated object.

It is the responsability of the engine to render the NPCs in the room, not the `Level Generator`.
