# Level Generator

## Objective

Generate tile-based [levels](definitions/level_definition.md#what-is-a-level) in a [Metroidvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania) style.

The project is also a testbed for me to learn the [RUST programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Definitions

All the necessary definitions to understand the `Level Generator` are laid out in [their dedicated section](definitions/README.md#definitions).

## Generation Order

Once the definitions are understood, the `Level Generator` can [execute the proper steps](generation/README.md#generation-order).
